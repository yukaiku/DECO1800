                                        On the first week, we were given an assignment, where we were told to make use of<br>
                                        the datasets provided by the State Library of Queensland to come up with<br>
                                        interesting and interactive applications that could relate to museums.<br>
                                        The first step i did was come up with as many ideas as possible using <br>
                                        the datasets available before thinking of the feasibility.
                                    </p>

                                        On the second week, i narrowed down on the dataset i wanted to use.<br>
                                        Using the SCAMPER technique learned in class, i came up with ideas<br>
                                        on how to improve it. With the put to other use of scamper to<br>
                                        generate different quiz ideas, and modify to think of different ways of<br>
                                        ask a question, i came up with a rough draft of my idea.

                                        Once i have a rough idea of what application i wanted to make,<br>
                                        i started making prototypes. Making use of the software, i found online<br>
                                        <a href='https://www.canva.com' target="_blank">Canva</a>, i created wire frames and asked my target audience to come up <br>

                                    After the roles were assigned i went back to do some research <br>
                                    of my own based off the feedback on assignment 1. I looked up <br>
                                    similar applications and how the designs was made to be user-friendly.<br>
                                    When we are in class i would check up on each of their individual task<br>
                                    to make sure they were on schedule. Any images and notes drawn in class<br>
                                    was uploaded on <a href="https://deco1800-2019.padlet.org/yu_kai_ku/2ebeb3q8e7tg" target="_blank">padlet</a>
                                    where i wrote a list of task for the team<br>
                                    based off what was discussed.

                                    Once i got some inspirations for the designs and layout from the application,<br>
                                    i drew some wire-frames for the paper test plan held in class.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="section-div">
                                <p class='popup-text-float-left'>
                                    After gathering the feedbacks and Ray, did the mock wire frame layout<br>
                                    using HTML and CSS, however the web-site at that point was not responsive<br>
                                    therefore, after discussing with the team, due to time constraints,<br>
                                    i reworked it and made a cleaner design based off the layout given.<br>
                                    Once that was done i started out coding the MVP for the application for<br>
                                    the Demo. Functions such as the QR code scanner, i sourced out various<br>
                                    library and ended up with instascan. I also applied the randomiser function<br>
                                    using PHP and a GET function to alter the questions to be asked at random.

                                    After this assignment was submitted and through the feedbacks<br>
                                    i learnt a few lessons and decided to use it for my next assignment.<br>
                                    Firstly, i realised the minimalist design of the application was not<br>
                                    well received by the audience and had to redesign it to suit the theme<br>
                                    of the application<br>
                                    Secondly, i understood the skills and habits of each of the team members.<br>
                                    Using that knowledge, i reshuffle the workload of everyone, and gave each<br>
                                    member a task more suitable for them.<br>
                                    Lastly, i decided to check up on them more by ensuring they update the padlet<br>
                                    whenever they finish a task and also ensured everyone had the links to all the<br>
                                    sites that we used.

                                This time around, i gave myself the supporting role,<br>
                                after i wrote the framework of the report, i would take over<br>
                                the coding of the functions from Ray after he redesigned<br>
                                the web-site with more animation and colors.

                                supposed to do, i started drafting some layouts for possible<br>
                                poster and banners we could put up on the trade show.<br>
                                After the task for each deliverable needed for the trade show<br>
                                was assigned, i got back and started making the Photoshop<br>
                                layouts for the posters and banners before Ray eventually took<br>
                                over and updated the flyers.

                                This assignment has been an overall challenging one as<br>
                                i had to work with team members that has all sorts of difficulty<br>
                                from being not knowing what their own task were to missing for weeks.<br>
                                I learnt to plan ahead and also have a backup plan in the event that<br>
                                one member is unable to do the work, i had already done it in my spare time<br>
                                during the 1 week break. Although, regrettably, the people i least expected<br>
                                disappeared, we still managed to get a working product with the design updated.<br>
                                If given another chance, i would have contacted the tutors at the first point<br>
                                of such incident happening rather than trying to have backup plan.<br>
                                Alternatively i would have also set up more weekly meetings outside the class<br>
                                to ensure everyone does their work and is updated with what each other has done.
